# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-CNN-and-RNN

•	Applied data science techniques to solve business-critical problems on Human Activity Recognition(HAR) using Neural Networks. Brainstormed with data personnel to define data modelling standards and architect database solutions. Created data models for HAR and developed Apache Spark ETL pipelines to efficiently ingest data from multiple disparate sources to HDFS cluster using Sqoop, Flume. Managed Big Data on a cluster with HDFS and MapReduce, used Apache Ambari for managing and monitoring HDFS. Provided analytical querying capabilities via Cassandra, Hive, HBase, and Presto for various business strategies.


•	Identified, analysed, and interpreted trends in data and applied CNN and RNN techniques to effectively perform HAR. Methods like transfer learning and regularisation were applied to improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and activation functions were tuned to optimise model performance. Models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 


•	Experience with HAR datasets, such as UCI-HAR and WISDM with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch. Created dashboards, translating complex datasets into comprehensive visual representations using Zeppelin for presenting to stakeholders in a concise manner.
